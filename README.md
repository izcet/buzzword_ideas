This script maximizes comedic effect in a very "cards against humanity" or "Mad Libs" kind of way.
```
$> ./buzzwords.sh

	What about a program which'll be able to provide end-to-end encryption for the emotional spectrum?

$> ./buzzwords.sh

	What about a mobile app that could privatize the user experience?

$> ./buzzwords.sh

	I think the world needs a browser plugin that can deanonymize hope.

$> ./buzzwords.sh

	I think the world needs a mobile app which can blockchainize the blockchain.

$> ./buzzwords.sh

### Future Iterations
- Translate to python and/or javascript to improve portability, and prepare for a web-enabled experience
- Apply markov chains to the sentence generation to improve the linguistic flow.
- Put this on a website where users get a new idea each page visit.
- Crowdsource content (users can add their own buzzwords)
- Adjust chain selections based on popularity (maybe a voting system or something)
- Add a secondary chain, kind of like http://whothefuckismydndcharacter.com/
